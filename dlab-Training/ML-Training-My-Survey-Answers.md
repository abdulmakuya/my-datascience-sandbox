### -If you have experience with machine learning? What is your favorite Machine Learning Algorithm? And why?    
  I generally start with regression algorithm (Logistic/linear) and documenting the results I get,I keep doing feature       engineering/reduction
  (by reducing multicolliniarity,choosing most importance),
  Principal Component Analysis and see what is the best result I could get out of these processes.
  
  Then I try with decision tree regressor/classifier (depending on the question on table) and see what results I get.I would then step 
  ahead to further advanced algo like Random forest,Support Vector Machine or neural networks.
  
  If the results (accuracy score by using train and test data ) dont significantly improve with the increase of algorithm's complexity,then 
  I would finally choose the less complex one.in favour of explainability and the Ocam's Razor rule
  
### Given a problem, how comfortable are you in your ability to analyze the data and build a machine learning solution for problem? 
  I am confident enough,let me elaborate the steps I would pass through
  - Data Cleaning/wrangling
    Check for duplicates,null values,
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
    Play around with the data,see the distribution,outliers,
  - Feature engineering/Dimensionality reduction
  - Model Creation
    Import,initialize and fit
    
  - Fine tuning,iterating to improve accuracy score
  
### What are the possible applications of Machine learning and related fields in the real world? *
  Understanding user needs,clusters and behaviour in various scenarios and industries in businesses

### What do you think is the difference between Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Deep Learning? *
   Artificial Intelligence is any kind of intelligence mimicking natural intelligence but exhibited by a machine,Machine learning is the    process of teaching this machine before it becomes intelligent.

### What are the ethical implications of using machine learning? *
  I think is the proper use and being careful that unintended catastrophic scenarios don't occur. Foristance the scandal on identifying a black person as a gorilla.Also by making data and AI capabilities open so that its not monopolized by a certain entity.
  
### What is the difference between Regression and Classification? *
  Regression refers to problems that output continuous data,foristance we can have a model that predicts someone's height by looking at their gender,race,weight etc.,WHILE regression are the problems that output classes/classify datapoints into groups foristance say whether a fruit is an apple or orange based on the weight and color score
