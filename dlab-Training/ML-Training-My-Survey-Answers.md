### -If you have experience with machine learning? What is your favorite Machine Learning Algorithm? And why?    
  I generally start with regression algorithm (Logistic/linear) and documenting the results I get,I keep doing feature       engineering/reduction
  (by reducing multicolliniarity,choosing most importance),
  Principal Component Analysis and see what is the best result I could get out of these processes.
  
  Then I try with decision tree regressor/classifier (depending on the question on table) and see what results I get.I would then step 
  ahead to further advanced algo like Random forest,Support Vector Machine or neural networks.
  
  If the results (accuracy score by using train and test data ) dont significantly improve with the increase of algorithm's complexity,then 
  I would finally choose the less complex one.in favour of explainability and the Ocam's Razor rule
  
### Given a problem, how comfortable are you in your ability to analyze the data and build a machine learning solution for problem? 
  I am confident enough,let me elaborate the steps I would pass through
  - Data Cleaning/wrangling
    Check for duplicates,null values,
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
    Play around with the data,see the distribution,outliers,
  - Feature engineering/Dimensionality reduction
  - Model Creation
    Import,initialize and fit
    
  - Fine tuning,iterating to improve accuracy score
