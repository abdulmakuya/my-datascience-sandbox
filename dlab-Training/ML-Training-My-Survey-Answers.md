### -If you have experience with machine learning? What is your favorite Machine Learning Algorithm? And why?    
  I generally start with a linear regression or classifier and documenting the results I get,I keep doing feature engineering/reduction
  (by reducing multicolliniarity,choosing most importance),
  Principal Component Analysis and see what is the best result I could get out of these processes.
  
  Then I try with decision tree regressor/classifier (depending on the question on table) and see what results I get.I would then step 
  ahead to further advanced algo like Random forest,Support Vector Machine or neural networks.
  
  If the results (accuracy score by using train and test data ) dont significantly improve with the increase of algorithm's complexity,then 
  I would finally choose the less complex one.in favour of explainability and the Ocam's Razor rule
